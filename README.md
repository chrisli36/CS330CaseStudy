# CS330CaseStudy
&emsp;This project worked towards developing an algorithmic system to dispatch drivers to passengers within a ride request service. We were able to design a system that balances minimizing passenger wait time, driver ride profit, and runtime/scalability.<br/><br/>
&emsp;In order to do this, we implemented the A-star algorithm to improve passenger-driver matching. To improve vertex locating speed we implemented an algorithm similar to quadtrees which decreases the time taken to locate a closest vertex. Finally, we analyzed several ways to improve our algorithm based on the given desiderata as discussed throughout the presentation.<br/><br/>
